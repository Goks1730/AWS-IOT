## AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C

Step1: Install the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C

Download the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C to your device from GitHub
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-c.git --recurse-submodules
```
Install OpenSSL version 1.1.0 or later. The OpenSSL development libraries are usually called "libssl-dev" or "openssl-devel" when installed through a package manager.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```
Step 2: Configure the sample app

You must configure the sample with your personal AWS IoT Core endpoint, private key, certificate, and root CA certificate. Navigate to the aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-c/demos/mqtt/mqtt_demo_mutual_auth directory.

```bash
// Get from demo_config.h
// =================================================
#define AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT               "my-endpoint-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
#define AWS_MQTT_PORT                  8883
#define CLIENT_IDENTIFIER              "testclient"
#define ROOT_CA_CERT_PATH              "certificates/AmazonRootCA1.crt"
#define CLIENT_CERT_PATH               "certificates/my-device-cert.pem.crt"
#define CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH        "certificates/my-device-private-key.pem.key"
// ================================================= 
```

Step3: Build and run the sample application
To run the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C sample applications

Navigate to aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-c and create a build directory.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```
Step4: Enter the following CMake command to generate the Makefiles needed to build.

```bash
cmake ..  
```
Step5: Enter the following command to build the executable app file.

```bash
make
```
Step6: Run the mqtt_demo_mutual_auth app with this command.

```bash
cd bin
./mqtt_demo_mutual_auth 
```

## View MQTT messages with the AWS IoT MQTT client

In the Subscribe to a topic tab, enter the topicName to subscribe to the topic on which your device publishes.

The topic message log page,  opens and  appears in the Subscriptions list. If the device that you configured in Configure your device is running the example program, you should see the messages it sends to AWS IoT in the message log. The message log entries will appear below the Publish section when messages with the subscribed topic are received by AWS IoT.


<img width="737" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Goks1730/AWS-IOT/assets/84590536/439d3fcf-2efc-4753-9a83-f93891f9c271">

Choose one MQTT client, in the Publish to a topic tab, in the Topic name field, enter the topicName of your message. In this example, testclient/example/topic. Try publishing the message a few times. From the Subscriptions list of both MQTT clients, you should be able to see that the clients receive the message. In this example, we publish the same message "Hello from AWS IoT console".

## handshake   

## Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. 

```javascript
The 'client hello' message: The client initiates the handshake by sending a "hello" message to the server. The message will include which TLS version the client supports, the cipher suites supported, and a string of random bytes known as the "client random."
```
<img width="926" alt="client hello" src="https://github.com/Goks1730/AWS-IOT/assets/84590536/202a0ae7-1d06-44b0-9622-bde2c401c19e">

```javascript
The 'server hello' message: In reply to the client hello message, the server sends a message containing the server's SSL certificate, the server's chosen cipher suite, and the "server random
```
<img width="936" alt="server hello" src="https://github.com/Goks1730/AWS-IOT/assets/84590536/e9d89eda-3ac1-4295-9320-1e484bdb7850">

## The client performs authentication by contacting the server’s certificate authority (CA) to validate the web server’s digital certificate. This confirms the authenticity of the web server, thus, establishing trust.

<img width="925" alt="server key exchange" src="https://github.com/Goks1730/AWS-IOT/assets/84590536/15bb34ff-f91b-486d-854a-10f6236a7607">

```javascript
During the ClientKeyExchange step, the client extracts the public key from the verified certificate and generates a new random sequence called the premaster secret. The premaster secret is then encrypted using the extracted public key and is sent to the server. Te SSL/TLS server decrypts the premaster secret using its private key.

Both the client and the server now use the premaster secret to configure a shared secret key. Next, the client sends an encrypted “finished” message using the shared secret key. This message says that the client’s part of the handshake is complete.
```
<img width="926" alt="process" src="https://github.com/Goks1730/AWS-IOT/assets/84590536/75f53cb8-c39f-4ffc-8733-ac02759d612b">

```javascript
Step 8: Finally, an encrypted “finished” message is sent back to the client from the server using the previously agreed shared secret key, which indicates the end of the server’s side of the handshake.
Step 9: Once the SSL/TLS handshake and negotiation is done, the server and the client communication continues, i.e., they begin to share files and messages using the session keys (symmetric encryption).
